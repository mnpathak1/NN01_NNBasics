# NN01_NNBasics
In this course, basic structure and algorithm of neural network are covered:
1. Numpy Python basics for neural network 
2. Building deep neural network step-by-step:
  * Forward propagation (Z=WA+b, A=g(Z))
  * Activation (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
  * Cost
  * Backward propagation (dZ = dA*g'(Z))
 Â * Parameter update
