# NN01_NNBasics
In this course by Prof Ng, basic structure and algorithm of neural network are covered. 
First, some Numpy Python basics for neural network are revised. After that, a 2-layer and 'L' layer
deep neural network is gone thourgh step-by-step in Python:
  * Forward propagation with weights, bias and initialization (Z=WA+b, A=g(Z))
  * Activation (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
  * Backward propagation (dZ = dA*g'(Z))
  * Cost for logistic (and other) classification  
 Â * Parameter update with gradient and learning rate
